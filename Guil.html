    <h2>The Witch</h2>
    <p>The Witch was young when we gave her that horrible task. She was sent to the Cradle, to watch over Trent Quar's Isolation.</p>
    <p>She has taken the form of a Human, though age cannot touch her. She is alone, unable to access most of her power.</p>
    <p>She leads them. She does so much to help the poor mortals, even as she watches them wither in her hands.</p>
    <p>I hear her cries, wishing that she could leave. Wishing that she could be reunited with the rest of her people.</p>
    <p>I cry with her.</p>
